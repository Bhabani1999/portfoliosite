            <p class="_16px max9">Most teachers admit the importance of remembering the names of their students. They consciously put efforts unless the class is too large.

                <p class="_16px max9">The app needed data in the form of names and pictures of students to be operable. While teachers could always input data by themselves, I realised it was not a feasible option. Teachers at the start of a semester are already burdened by paperwork, material preparation and other stuff. A class of 60-80 students would certainly discourage teachers from populating student data. The adoption of the app in such a case becomes low because of the barrier before the goal. It was clear; I had to get around the problem.</p>

              <div class="div-block-91">
                <p class="_16px max9">At this point, one could ask why not use the data from directories that every school kept. For example, if a school maintains a spreadsheet of student information of every class, we could find a way to covert the spreadsheet into populating the app. A run-of-the-mill inquiry into the functioning of schools revealed that such paperwork was mostly offline and even if they were online, several schools had policies to not directly share student information with individual teachers due to privacy reasons.</p>

              <div class="div-block-90">
                <p class="_16px max9">I had to find a proper pipeline through which data could be populated automatically. Researching, I found out Google already had a classroom app ‘Google Classroom’. The recent pandemic had made the app immensely popular. The reason partly being it could be used to make announcements, provide material and assignments for a class in a single channel. Teachers sent out a classroom code, and students had to enter the code in their app to be a part of the class on Google Classroom. This junction appeared to be the perfect gateway for automatic data population for teachers.</p>

Any particular goal is divided into different levels or tasks, and the user is informed of the completion level of each lesson. Similar techniques are also employed by Twitter and Quora to add value to simple tasks and motivate users to go deep into the process of the app.</p>

                <p class="_14px-2">‘Google Classbook’ seemed to strike a perfect balance. Naming it so makes it a part of a sub ecosystem ‘Google Classroom’. This particularly emphasises the connection between two apps. The visual language and the logo were also designed so as to unify the visual identity and in fact, create a strong brand presence of ‘Classroom’ for a possible chain of ed-tech apps under the ‘Classroom’ brand in the future.</p>
                <p class="_14px-2">At the same time, the name also reemphasises the goal the app was created for: To help teachers create a personalised student information system that helps them build better relations with students apart from helping them memorising names.<br></p>
